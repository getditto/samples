# Online With Authentication server

The ditto portal will attempt to reach this server. That means you must deploy the server where the post endpoint is accessible. For testing, you can use a quick-deploy service such as [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

## Local Usage

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
